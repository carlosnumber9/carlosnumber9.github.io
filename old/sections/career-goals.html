<h3 class="section-title"> CAREER GOALS </h3>
<p class="main-content">
    My main objective right now is to achieve enough web development knowledge 
    and experience to be able to work on my own. That does not necessarily mean 
    to work as a freelance web developer (Which I would love to try), but it would 
    also be to work inside a company that allows me to manage my time with freedom 
    (Once I prove that I'm able to produce independently).

<p class="main-content">
    Working around the world is something that I would love to try, too. I'm 
    aware of the great opportunities I can get out there, but I currently keep 
    looking for the right place where I can improve my skills and become a senior.
